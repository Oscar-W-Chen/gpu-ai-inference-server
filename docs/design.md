# GPU Inference Server: Key Components and Data Flow

## Key Components

### 1. Go Server (main.go)
- Entry point for the inference server
- HTTP/REST and gRPC API endpoints
- Request handling and routing
- Server lifecycle management

### 2. Go Inference Binding
- CGO bindings to the C++ implementation
- Converts Go types to C/C++ types and vice versa
- Passes requests from Go to the C++ layer

### 3. Inference Bridge (C API)
- C API layer that exposes C++ functionality to Go
- Manages resources and memory allocations
- Converts between C and C++ data structures

### 4. Inference Manager
- Acts as the orchestrator for all inference operations
- Manages the model repository and model lifecycle
- Coordinates request scheduling and batching
- Handles resource allocation across multiple models
- Monitors system health and performance metrics

### 5. Model
- Represents a loaded ML model in memory
- Handles model-specific operations and configuration
- Manages model versions and instances
- Interfaces with appropriate backend for execution

### 6. CUDA Utilities
- GPU detection and capability querying
- Memory management for GPU operations
- CUDA kernel execution helpers
- Tensor data transfer between CPU and GPU

### 7. Model Backends
- Framework-specific implementations (TensorRT, ONNX, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Handles inference execution for specific model types
- Optimizes model execution for GPU

### 8. GPU Memory Management
- Efficient memory allocation/deallocation for tensors
- Memory pooling to reduce allocation overhead
- Shared memory for multi-model execution

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**: Client sends inference request to the Go server via HTTP/REST or gRPC
2. **Request Validation**: Go server validates the request and prepares input data
3. **Go to C++ Bridge**: Go inference binding converts input data to C-compatible format
4. **C to C++ Translation**: Inference Bridge receives the request and forwards it to the Inference Manager
5. **Request Orchestration**: Inference Manager:
   - Validates the request
   - Identifies the target model
   - Applies batching policies if necessary
   - Allocates resources for the request
6. **Model Preparation**: Inference Manager forwards the request to the appropriate Model instance
7. **GPU Resource Allocation**: CUDA utilities prepare input tensors on the GPU
8. **Inference Execution**: Model backend executes inference on the GPU
9. **Result Processing**: Results are processed and prepared for return
10. **Response Return Path**: Results flow back through:
    - Model → Inference Manager → Inference Bridge → Go Binding → Go Server → Client

## Component Interactions

### Inference Manager ↔ Model
- The Inference Manager loads, initializes, and manages Model instances
- It tracks model versions, status, and performance metrics
- Directs inference requests to the appropriate Model instance

### Inference Manager ↔ CUDA Utils
- Uses CUDA utilities to query GPU capabilities and status
- Allocates GPU resources for models based on their requirements
- Monitors GPU memory usage and optimizes allocation

### Model ↔ CUDA Utils
- Models use CUDA utilities for tensor operations
- Handles data transfer between CPU and GPU memory
- Executes model-specific CUDA kernels

### Model ↔ Model Backends
- Models interface with appropriate backends based on their type
- Backends provide optimized inference implementation
- Handles framework-specific operations and optimizations
